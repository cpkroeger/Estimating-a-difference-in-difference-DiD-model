# Minimum Wage and Employment Study - New Jersey vs Pennsylvania (1992)

This dataset comes from a study by David Card and Alan Krueger (1993) titled "Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania." The study gathers data on the impact of the minimum wage increase in New Jersey in April 1992 on employment in the fast-food industry by comparing it to Pennsylvania. To analyze the impact of the minimum wage increase I used the Difference-in-Differences which proved minimum wage did not change during this period.
